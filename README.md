# Weather App

[Link](https://weather-app.renv123.vercel.app/)

A minimalist site that displays the weather info. Along with a picture
of the entered location. Created as an exercise to learn API's.
The site asks for the users location and retrieves weather data for it,
otherwise the user can enter a location.

## Vercel
To make the site available without exposing my API keys, I've used Vercel
to make a serverless api that wraps these calls. Take a look at the 
vercel-serverless-functions branch for more info.



## Tools/Frameworks/Languages used:
 * JS, HTML and CSS
 * Axios for the API Requests
 * [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)
 * [OpenCageData API](https://opencagedata.com/) Used for reverse geocoding
 * [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/) for images
 * [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for serverless functions.
