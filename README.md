# Weather App

A minimalistic site that displays the weather info. Along with a picture
of the entered location. Created as an exercise to learn API's.
The site asks for the users location and retrieves weather data for it,
otherwise the user can enter a location.

Note: The deployed site currently doesn't work because I will not push the
API keys to github. I'm trying to find a way around this problem.
